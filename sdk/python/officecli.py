officecli — a thin Python shell over officecli's resident pipe.

It does ONE thing: forward a command to the running resident over its named
pipe and hand back the response. There is NO second vocabulary to learn: a
command is the same dict you'd put in an officecli `batch` list — e.g.
{"command":"set","path":"/Sheet1/A1","props":{"text":"Hello"}}. `send` forwards
one; `batch` forwards many in a single round-trip.

Two surfaces, by design:
  - bootstrap (infrequent): `create` / `open` spawn ONE CLI process — a file that
    isn't open yet (or doesn't exist yet) has no resident to talk to.
  - everything else (the hot path): `send` / `batch` are pure pipe round-trips,
    no per-command process spawn.

    import officecli
    with officecli.create("report.xlsx", "--force") as doc:   # make file + get handle
        doc.send({"command": "set", "path": "/Sheet1/A1",
                  "props": {"text": "Hello"}})
        print(doc.send({"command": "get", "path": "/Sheet1/A1"}))
        doc.send({"command": "save"})
    # ...or officecli.open("existing.xlsx") for a file that already exists.

The item keys are officecli's batch fields (command/op, path, parent, type,
index, after, before, to, selector, text, mode, depth, part, xpath, action,
xml) plus a nested `props` dict. Everything except command/op/props is
forwarded verbatim as a command argument; the resident dispatches it exactly
like the matching CLI command. See `officecli help` / the batch docs for the
field-and-prop reference — this shell adds none of its own.

Protocol (matches ResidentServer.cs / ResidentClient.cs):
  - pipe name : officecli-<SHA256(fullpath)[:16] uppercase>;
                fullpath upper-cased on macOS/Windows, left as-is on Linux.
  - unix path : $TMPDIR/CoreFxPipe_<name> (+ "-ping"), with the same short
                fallback directory as OfficeCLI when the socket path is too long
  - win path  : \\.\pipe\<name>            (+ "-ping")
  - framing   : one request line + one response line, UTF-8, '\n' terminated;
                one connection == one command.
  - request   : PascalCase {"Command","Args","Props","Json"}
  - response  : {"ExitCode","Stdout","Stderr"}
